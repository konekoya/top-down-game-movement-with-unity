# Top down game movement in Unity.

### What is this?

This is a fast prototype of using a same sprite asset to create a simple 2D top down movement with Unity.

### Why?

While I'm in the process of learning Game development with Unity, I've noticed that Top-down game movement can be achieved mainly in two ways: one with Unity's Blend Trees and the other with scripting. (There might be more ways to do so as I said I'm still learning game development :)) So I'm creating this little project in hope to find out best way to work with 2D top-down game movement

### The tutorials

I basically followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ijgw2i0mmi&ab_channel=danikrossing) tutorial for player movement only thur code and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRpoE4FfJf8&ab_channel=JTAGames) for using Blend Trees only.

> There are more tutorials like this available on YT. You can find out more [here](https://github.com/konekoya/game-dev-links#2d-movement-and-animation)

The asses I used in both tutorial is a free asset and is available [here](https://limezu.itch.io/moderninteriors). But you probably won't need to download that as the asset is already imported in the Unity editor
